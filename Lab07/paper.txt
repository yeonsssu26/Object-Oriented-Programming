In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a
medical training system for breast tumor palpation based on haptic
augmented reality (AR) technology. Haptic AR is an emerging
research area in haptics and virtual reality
(VR), which is concerned
with augmenting the haptic
properties of a real object by means of virtual haptic
feedback. The AR-based tumor palpation system
consists of a real breast sample.
